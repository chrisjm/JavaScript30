  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log("Original", age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log("Updated age:", age, age2);

    let name = 'Chris';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log("Original", name, name2);
    name = 'Christopher';
    console.log("Updated name:", name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log("Copy team from players:", team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // Examples of reference
    console.log("Updated team (reference):", players, team);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "derp";
    console.log("Updated players (copy via slice()):", players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Chimichanga";
    console.log("Updated players (copy via concat())", players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'derp de derrrr';
    console.log("Updated players (copy via spread))", players, team4);

    // or use from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Sweeeeeet';
    console.log("Update players (copy via Array.from())", players, team5);

    // With Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Chris Mears',
      age: 36
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log("Add number to const person (reference):", captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log("Copy object using assign():", cap2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Not in JS yet :(
    //
    // const capt3 = {...person};
    // capt3.age = 25;
    // console.log("Copy object using spread:", capt3, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const chris = {
      name: 'Chris',
      age: 36,
      social: {
        twitter: '@chrisjm',
        facebook: 'chrisjm.developer'
      }
    }

    // assign() only does  1-level deep
    const dev = Object.assign({}, chris);
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolguy';
    console.log("Shallow clone:", dev, chris);

    // Poor-man's deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(chris));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@cooldude';
    console.log("Deep clone via JSON.parse/stringify:", dev2, chris);
